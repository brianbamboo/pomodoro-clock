# Pomodoro Clock App

This is a simple Pomodoro clock app created using HTML, Bootstrap/CSS, and Javascript/jQuery. 
An instance of this app is deployed on [Heroku](https://pomodoro-clock-w2a3xturek.herokuapp.com/index.html).

## Motivation
The motivation for this project was to gain some more experience with front-end development and create a functional and well-designed app using Javascript and HTML/CSS.

## File descriptions
This directory contains an index.html file for the front-end layout, a CSS stylesheet, and a clock.js file containing the app logic. The index.php file is used for deployment on Heroku.

## Authors
The author of this app is me!

## Acknowledgments
The idea for this project comes from FreeCodeCamp.
